## Setting up a new macOS for development

*Attention: This is a Work in Progress. Please be careful when setting up your brand-new macOS*

### Before:

* Backup all apps or make a list of those that you want to be migrated to your new macOS
* Have a look at your current **Atom.app** or **Sublime Text.app** setup and also make a list of those plugins and stuff that you want to migrate. 

### After:

* Use [thoughtbot's laptop script](https://github.com/thoughtbot/laptop) to setup the base of your macOS
* Install all scripts or other bash related things that failed or that are missing (could also be done by a `.laptop.local` script.
* Download the [US German Keyboard Layout](https://hci.rwth-aachen.de/USGermanKeyboard) for the sake of Umlauts
* Install needed fonts on your macOS installation from our internal Dropbox `Fonts` folder.
* Install all the stuff that was backed up in the *Before* section.. well... before.
* Setup your emails, Harvest and Flow apps

Yep, you are almost done. Some private installations and stuff on your Macbook and you are done to go and develop on your current/new project.
